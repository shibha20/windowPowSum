# windowPowSum

windowPosSum(int[] a, int n) replaces each element a[i] with the sum of a[i] through a[i + n], but only if a[i] is positive valued. If there are not enough values because we reach the end of the array, we sum only as many values as we have.

For example, suppose we call windowPosSum with the array a = {1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 4}, and n = 3. In this case, we’d:

Replace a[0] with a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3].
Replace a[1] with a[1] + a[2] + a[3] + a[4].
Not do anything to a[2] because it’s negative.
Replace a[3] with a[3] + a[4] + a[5].
Replace a[4] with a[4] + a[5].
Not do anything with a[5] because there are no values after a[5].
Thus, the result after calling windowPosSum would be {4, 8, -3, 13, 9, 4}.

As another example, if we called windowPosSum with the array a = {1, -1, -1, 10, 5, -1}, and n = 2, we’d get {-1, -1, -1, 14, 4, -1}.
